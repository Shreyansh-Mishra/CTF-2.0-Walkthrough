The text is actually written in Rockstar Language.

`Listen` in Rockstar is a command that will take an input from the user. There are 2 Listen commands in the program the first one is irrelevant and you can give any input for it.  

Refer to [Rockstar Documentation](https://codewithrockstar.com/docs) on how `shout`, `is` and `without` work.

Value of Saurav before the second input = 114  
Value of Shakespeare before the second input = 18

Saurav without Shakespeare = 114 - 18 = 96  

This should be your second input, entering which you will get the correct output of the program.  

Output: 109
101
114
99
117
114
121

The above output are just ASCII values of the characters, converting them to their corresponding characters will give the flag.
