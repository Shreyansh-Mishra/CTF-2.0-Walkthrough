## Answer
```
flag{W3lcom3_to_D1$n3y_@11Ad1n}
```

## Solution
Fix the file headers of the png and jpg files (you can use hexinator), they are:  

PNG: 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A   
JPG: FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46  

Upon fixing the png file you will find key1.  

Upon fixing the jpg file you will see something written in brainfuck in the metadata of the image, compiling it will give you a password. Use that password for steganography on the same file, after doing steganography you will get key2.


Concatenating key1 and key2 will give you the password for the zip file.  

After opening the zip file run the `strings` command on the image or open that image with Notepad and you will find the flag at the end of the file.
