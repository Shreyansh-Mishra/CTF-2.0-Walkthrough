## Solution
It's a simple reverse engineering problem.
the `bhagwanMeths` function is irrelevant as it will return 0 as the value.  

The Code to solve the problem is:  
```python
ls=[0xf, 0x5, 0x8, 0xe, 0x12, 0xa, 0x5d, 0x27, 0x1c, 0x59, 0x24, 0x36, 0x2f, 0x5d, 0x5f, 0x1d, 0x36, 0x5c, 0x7, 0x5d, 0x2, 0x2c, 0x5c, 0x36, 0x27, 0x5a, 0x3f, 0x5a, 0x1b, 0x36, 0x2a, 0x58, 0x59, 0x3e, 0x20, 0xa, 0x31, 0x5, 0x5e, 0x4, 0x3f, 0xa, 0x20, 0x14, 0x5e, 0x3e, 0x14]

s = [chr(i) for i in ls]

#reverse the xor done in veryRealTreasure.h
for i in range(len(s)):
    s[i]=chr(ord(s[i])^0x69)

#reverse the shifting done in treasure.cpp
for i in range(33,46):
    s[i]=chr(ord(s[i])-(420%26))

for i in range(5,10,3):
    s[i]=chr(ord(s[i])-(69%26))

print("".join(s))
```
